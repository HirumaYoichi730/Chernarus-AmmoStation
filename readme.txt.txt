DayZ Chernarus - AmmoStation.
I had this idea Ammo Station where there you can go and get just the ammo for the weapons you use.

This has been tested on Xbox One. And hopefully this should work on PC and on PS as well.
However, if there is some errors or bugs with this file. Please feel free to email to 
hirumayoichi730@gmail.com with some screenshots.

So, the only things that are in this file is the following:

1: 1x Land_Village_PoliceStation.
2: 2x Bonfire.
3: Several ammoboxex for following:
Ammo: 5.56x45mm and Tracer rounds.
Ammo: 308 Win and Tracer rounds.
Ammo: 7.62x54mmR and Tracer rounds.
Ammo: 7.62x39mm and Tracer rounds.
Ammo: .22 LR Rounds.
Ammo: .357 Rounds.
Ammo: .45 ACP Rounds.
Ammo: 9x19mm Rounds.
Ammo: .380 ACP Rounds.
Ammo: 12ga -> 00 Buckshots, Rifled Slugs. Rubber Slugs and Beanbag Slugs.
Ammo: 5.45x39mm and Tracer rounds.
Ammo: 9x39mm and Armour-Piercing rounds.
Then there is some other ammos for the signal pistol and for the M79 Grenade launcher.
For the Signal Pistol there is following:
Blue, Red, Green and Yellow flares to pick up if you like.
And lastley for the M79 Grenade Launcher, there is the following:
40mm Explosive Grenade, PO-X Grenade and Smoke Grenade(Red, Green, White and Black smokes).

So the AmmoStation is located outside Kabanino(Kabahnho) not far from the church, maybe 20-30 meters away from the church.
It´s also not far from NWAF. And Kabahnho is located just a litle southeast of NWAF. So if you are not sure where to look on the map
Just look for the big airfield on the left side of the map(about the same line as of Berezino).

How to install this file to your server:
Go to your Custom folder for your server, upload the file.
Then go to your cfggameplay.json file, go to "objectSpawnersArr": [ and type in "./custom/AmmoStation.json"
and if you have more custom files then add an , after ...json" like this -> "./custom/AmmoStation.json", "./custom/anotherfile.json" .
After that just save the changes and then restart the server and if all is done right then your server has a new base area.

Thank you for reading this text.
I hope you like this store.
